Original README:
================

CSSTidy is an opensource CSS parser and optimiser. It is available as executable file (available for Windows, Linux and OSX) which can be controlled per command line and as PHP script (both with almost the same functionality).

In opposite to most other CSS parsers, no regular expressions are used and thus CSSTidy has full CSS2 support and a higher reliability.

See the file INSTALL for building and installation instructions.

CSSTidy is free software. See the file csstidy/COPYING for copying conditions.
